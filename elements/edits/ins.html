    <h4>
    	The code looks like:

    <p style="color:blue">
    	All writers struggle with when to begin a new paragraph. &lt;ins&gt;Yet, in order to maintain coherence, writers must
		know when to make the transition to the next paragraph.&lt;/ins&gt; If a new idea comes into your writing, you must begin
		a new paragraph. A new idea should only be presented in a new paragraph. &lt;ins&gt;If not, the coherence of the paragraph
		will suffer.&lt;/ins&gt; New points should begin in the topic sentence of the next paragraph. You can also being a
		new paragraph to contrast the ideas presented in the prior paragraph. Sometimes, you may have a paragraph
		that has become lengthy (a page or more) and needs to be broken apart to maintain the stamina of your work.
		Find a place where your support is fully developed and create another paragraph that will complete the ideas
		presented prior.
