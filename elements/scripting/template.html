    <h2>Definition:</h2>
    <p>
    	The HTML &lt;template&gt; tag allows you to declare HTML fragments that can be cloned and inserted into the document by script. </br></br>

		The contents of the &lt;template&gt; tag are not rendered upon page load. Rather, they are cloned and inserted into the DOM when they need to be used - which could be based on an event such as user input. </br></br>

		The basic idea behind the &lt;template&gt; element is that it can be used over and over again. You can use the template as is, or you could add to it, for example, data from a database. Therefore it could be used to populate a large table with data, or a select list with new options perhaps based on user input. </br></br>
